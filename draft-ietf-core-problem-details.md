--- abstract

This document defines a "problem detail" as a way to carry
machine-readable details of errors in a REST response to avoid the
need to define new error response formats for REST APIs.
The format
is inspired by, but intended to be more concise than, the Problem
Details for HTTP APIs defined in RFC 7807.

# Introduction

REST response status information such as CoAP {{-coap}} response
codes is sometimes not sufficient to convey enough information about
an error to be helpful.  This specification defines a simple and extensible
framework to define CBOR {{-cbor}} data items to suit this purpose.
It is designed to be reused by REST APIs, which can identify distinct
"problem types" specific to their needs.
Thus, API clients can be informed of both the high-level error class
(using the response code) and the finer-grained details of the problem
(using this vocabulary), as shown in {{fig-problem-details}}.

   title="Problem Details: Example with CoAP"}

The framework presented is largely inspired by the Problem Details for HTTP APIs defined in {{RFC7807}}.

## Requirements Language

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Basic Problem Details

A Concise Problem Details data item is a CBOR data item with the following
structure (notated in CDDL {{!RFC8610}}):

~~~ CDDL
problem-details = non-empty<{
  ? &(title: -1) => text
  ? &(detail: -2) => text
  ? &(instance: -3) => ~uri
  ? &(response-code: -4) => uint .size 1
  standard-problem-detail-entries
  custom-problem-detail-entries
}>

standard-problem-detail-entries = (
  * nint => any
)

custom-problem-detail-entries = (
  * (uint/~uri) => { + any => any }
)

non-empty<M> = (M) .and ({ + any => any })
~~~
{: #cddl title="Problem Detail Data Item"}

A number of problem detail entries, the Standard Problem Detail
entries, are predefined (more predefined details can be registered,
see {{new-spdk}}):

{:vspace}
The title (key -1):
: A short, human-readable summary of the problem type.
  It SHOULD NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem.

The detail (key -2):
: A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem.

The instance (key -3):
: A URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of the problem.
  It may or may not yield further information if dereferenced.

The response-code (key -4)
: The CoAP response code ({{Section 5.9 of -coap}}) generated by the origin
  server for this occurrence of the problem.

Note that unlike {{RFC7807}} Concise Problem Details data items have no
explicit type.

The "title" string is advisory and included to give
consumers a shorthand for the category of the error encountered.

The "detail" member, if present, ought to focus on helping the client correct the problem, rather than giving debugging information.  Consumers SHOULD NOT parse the "detail" member for information; extensions (see {{sec-new-attributes}}) are more suitable and less error-prone ways to obtain such information.

Note that the "instance" URI reference may be relative; this means
that it must be resolved relative to the document's base URI, as per
{{-uri}}.
Note that the "response code" value is a numeric representation of the
actual code, so it does not take the usual form that resembles an
HTTP status code — `4.04 Not found` is represented by the number 132.

# Extending Concise Problem Details
{: #sec-new-attributes}

This specification defines a generic problem type container with only a
minimal set of attributes to make it usable.

It is expected that applications will extend the base format by defining new
attributes.

These new attributes fall into two categories: generic and application
specific.

Generic attributes will be allocated in the `standard-problem-detail-entries`
slot according to the registration procedure defined in {{new-spdk}}.

Application-specific attributes will be allocated in the
`custom-problem-detail-entries` slot according to the procedure described in
{{new-cpdk}}.

## Standard Problem Detail Entries {#new-spdk}

Beyond the Standard Problem Detail keys defined in {{cddl}}, additional
Standard Problem Detail keys can be registered in the
`standard-problem-detail-entries` slot (see {{iana-spdk}}).

Standard Problem Detail keys are negative integers, so they never can
conflict with Custom Problem Detail keys defined for a problem type
(which are unsigned integers or URIs.)

In summary, the keys for Standard Problem Detail entries are in a
global namespace that is not specific to a particular application domain.

Consumers of a Concise Problem Details instance MUST ignore any Standard Problem
Detail entries that they do not recognize; this allows problem types to evolve.

## Custom Problem Detail Entries {#new-cpdk}

Applications may extend the Problem Details document with
additional entries to convey additional, application-specific information.

Such new entries are allocated in the `custom-problem-detail-entries` slot, and
are nested into a map specific to that application.  The map key can either be
a URI (controlled by the entity defining this extension), or an unsigned int.
Only the latter needs to be registered ({{iana-cpdk}}).  Within the nested map
any number of attributes can exist.  When the extension is registered (i.e.,
unsigned int) the semantics of each custom attribute MUST be described in the
documentation that goes along with the registration.

The unsigned integer form allows a more compact representation but authors are
expected to comply with the required registration and documentation process.
In comparison, the URI form is less space-efficient but requires no
registration.  It is therefore ideal for experimenting during the development
cycle and for application deployed in environments where producers and
consumers of Concise Problem Details are more tightly integrated.

Note that the URI form is for identification purposes only and MUST NOT be
dereferenced in the normal course of handling problem details (i.e., outside
diagnostic/debugging procedures involving humans).

An example of a custom extension using a URI as `custom-problem-detail-entries`
key is shown in {{fig-example-custom-with-uri}}.

~~~
{
  / title /         -1: "title of the error",
  / detail /        -2: "detailed information about the error",
  / instance /      -3: "coaps://pd.example/FA317434",
  / response-code / -4: 128, / 4.00 /

  "tag:3gpp.org,2022-03:TS29112": {
    / cause /  0: "machine readable error cause",
    / invalidParams / 1: [
      [
        / param / "first parameter name",
        / reason / "must be a positive integer"
      ],
      [
        / param / "second parameter name"
      ]
    ],
    / supportedFeatures / 2: "d34db33f"
  }
}
~~~
{: #fig-example-custom-with-uri artwork-align="center"
   title="Example Extension with URI key"}

The same example but using a registered unsigned int as
`custom-problem-detail-entries` key is shown in
{{fig-example-custom-with-uint}}.

~~~
{
  / title /         -1: "title of the error",
  / detail /        -2: "detailed information about the error",
  / instance /      -3: "coaps://pd.example/FA317434",
  / response-code / -4: 128, / 4.00 /

  /example value 4711 not actually registered like this:/
  4711: {
    / cause /  0: "machine readable error cause",
    / invalidParams / 1: [
      [
        / param / "first parameter name",
        / reason / "must be a positive integer"
      ],
      [
        / param / "second parameter name"
      ]
    ],
    / supportedFeatures / 2: "d34db33f"
  }
}
~~~
{: #fig-example-custom-with-uint artwork-align="center"
   title="Example Extension with unsigned int (registered) key"}

In summary, the keys for Custom Problem Detail entries are grouped in
namespaces specific to a given application domain, the documentation of which
defines these entries.
Consumers of a Concise Problem Details instance MUST ignore any Custom Problem
Detail entries that they
do not recognize; this allows problem types to evolve and include
additional information in the future.
