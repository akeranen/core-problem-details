                 Concise Problem Details For CoAP APIs
                 draft-ietf-core-problem-details-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a "problem detail" as a way to carry machine-
   readable details of errors in a REST response to avoid the need to
   define new error response formats for REST APIs.  The format is
   inspired by, but intended to be more concise than, the Problem
   Details for HTTP APIs defined in RFC 7807.

1.  Introduction

   REST response status information such as CoAP response codes
   (Section 5.9 of [RFC7252]) is sometimes not sufficient to convey
   enough information about an error to be helpful.  This specification
   defines a simple and extensible framework to define CBOR [STD94] data
   items to suit this purpose.  It is designed to be reused by REST
   APIs, which can identify distinct "problem types" specific to their
   needs.  Thus, API clients can be informed of both the high-level
   error class (using the response code) and the finer-grained details
   of the problem (using this vocabulary), as shown in Figure 1.

   The framework presented is largely inspired by the Problem Details
   for HTTP APIs defined in [RFC7807].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Basic Problem Details

   A Concise Problem Details data item is a CBOR data item with the
   following structure (notated in CDDL [RFC8610]):

   problem-details = non-empty<{
     ? &(title: -1) => text
     ? &(detail: -2) => text
     ? &(instance: -3) => ~uri
     ? &(response-code: -4) => uint .size 1
     standard-problem-detail-entries
     custom-problem-detail-entries
   }>

   standard-problem-detail-entries = (
     * nint => any
   )

   custom-problem-detail-entries = (
     * (uint/~uri) => { + any => any }
   )

   non-empty<M> = (M) .and ({ + any => any })

                     Figure 2: Problem Detail Data Item

   A number of problem detail entries, the Standard Problem Detail
   entries, are predefined (more predefined details can be registered,
   see Section 3.1):

   The title (key -1):
      A short, human-readable summary of the problem type.  It SHOULD
      NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem.

   The detail (key -2):
      A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the
      problem.

   The instance (key -3):
      A URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of the
      problem.  It may or may not yield further information if
      dereferenced.

   The response-code (key -4)
      The CoAP response code (Section 5.9 of [RFC7252]) generated by the
      origin server for this occurrence of the problem.

   Note that, unlike [RFC7807], Concise Problem Details data items have
   no explicit type.

   The "title" string is advisory and included to give consumers a
   shorthand for the category of the error encountered.

   The "detail" member, if present, ought to focus on helping the client
   correct the problem, rather than giving debugging information.
   Consumers SHOULD NOT parse the "detail" member for information;
   extensions (see Section 3) are more suitable and less error-prone
   ways to obtain such information.

   Note that the "instance" URI reference may be relative; this means
   that it must be resolved relative to the representation's base URI,
   as per Section 5 of [STD66].

   Note that the "response code" value is a numeric representation of
   the actual code, so it does not take the usual form that resembles an
   HTTP status code -- 4.04 Not found is represented by the number 132.

3.  Extending Concise Problem Details

   This specification defines a generic problem type container with only
   a minimal set of attributes to make it usable.

   It is expected that applications will extend the base format by
   defining new attributes.

   These new attributes fall into two categories: generic and
   application specific.

   Generic attributes will be allocated in the standard-problem-detail-
   entries slot according to the registration procedure defined in
   Section 3.1.

   Application-specific attributes will be allocated in the custom-
   problem-detail-entries slot according to the procedure described in
   Section 3.2.

3.1.  Standard Problem Detail Entries

   Beyond the Standard Problem Detail keys defined in Figure 2,
   additional Standard Problem Detail keys can be registered for use in
   the standard-problem-detail-entries slot (see Section 5.1).

   Standard Problem Detail keys are negative integers, so they never can
   conflict with Custom Problem Detail keys defined for a specific
   application domain (which are unsigned integers or URIs.)

   In summary, the keys for Standard Problem Detail entries are in a
   global namespace that is not specific to a particular application
   domain.

   Consumers of a Concise Problem Details instance MUST ignore any
   Standard Problem Detail entries that they do not recognize; this
   allows problem details to evolve.

3.2.  Custom Problem Detail Entries

   Applications may extend the Problem Details data item with additional
   entries to convey additional, application-specific information.

   Such new entries are allocated in the custom-problem-detail-entries
   slot, and carry a nested map specific to that application.  The map
   key can either be an (absolute!)  URI (controlled by the entity
   defining this extension), or an unsigned integer.  Only the latter
   needs to be registered (Section 5.2).

   Within the nested map any number of attributes can be given for a
   single extension.  The semantics of each custom attribute MUST be
   described in the documentation for the extension; for extension that
   are registered (i.e., are identified by an unsigned int) that
   documentation goes along with the registration.

   The unsigned integer form allows a more compact representation, in
   exchange, authors are expected to comply with the required
   registration and documentation process.  In comparison, the URI form
   is less space-efficient but requires no registration.  It is
   therefore useful for experimenting during the development cycle and
   for applications deployed in environments where producers and
   consumers of Concise Problem Details are more tightly integrated.
   The URI form thus serves a similar function as "private use" numbers
   would serve if such a range were registered for the unsigned
   integers.

   Note that the URI given for the extension is for identification
   purposes only and, even if dereferenceable in principle, MUST NOT be
   dereferenced in the normal course of handling problem details (i.e.,
   outside diagnostic/debugging procedures involving humans).

   An example of a custom extension using a URI as custom-problem-
   detail-entries key is shown in Figure 3.

      {
        / title /         -1: "title of the error",
        / detail /        -2: "detailed information about the error",
        / instance /      -3: "coaps://pd.example/FA317434",
        / response-code / -4: 128, / 4.00 /

        "tag:3gpp.org,2022-03:TS29112": {
          / cause /  0: "machine readable error cause",
          / invalidParams / 1: [
            [
              / param / "first parameter name",
              / reason / "must be a positive integer"
            ],
            [
              / param / "second parameter name"
            ]
          ],
          / supportedFeatures / 2: "d34db33f"
        }
      }

                  Figure 3: Example Extension with URI key

   Obviously, an SDO like 3GPP can also easily register such a custom
   problem detail entry to receive a more efficient unsigned integer
   key; the same example but using a registered unsigned int as custom-
   problem-detail-entries key is shown in Figure 4.

      {
        / title /         -1: "title of the error",
        / detail /        -2: "detailed information about the error",
        / instance /      -3: "coaps://pd.example/FA317434",
        / response-code / -4: 128, / 4.00 /

        /example value 4711 not actually registered like this:/
        4711: {
          / cause /  0: "machine readable error cause",
          / invalidParams / 1: [
            [
              / param / "first parameter name",
              / reason / "must be a positive integer"
            ],
            [
              / param / "second parameter name"
            ]
          ],
          / supportedFeatures / 2: "d34db33f"
        }
      }

       Figure 4: Example Extension with unsigned int (registered) key

   In summary, the keys for the maps used inside Custom Problem Detail
   entries are defined specifically to the identifier of that Custom
   Problem Detail entry, the documentation of which defines these
   internal entries, typically chosen to address a given application
   domain.  Consumers of a Concise Problem Details instance MUST ignore
   any Custom Problem Detail entries, or keys inside the Custom Problem
   Detail entries, that they do not recognize; this allows Custom
   Problem Detail entries to evolve and include additional information
   in the future.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security and privacy considerations outlined in Section 5 of
   [RFC7807] apply in full.
